## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size, using **bootstrap** and **tailwind**, so you must create two different routes.
- One for bootstrap: `/bootstrap`
- One for tailwind: `/tailwind`

The link int the [links](#links) section takes the user to a page with a "menu". There, the user is able to select the framework he wants to use (bootstrap or tailwind) to visualize the design, obviously, with it being responsive depending on the device's screen dimensiones.
